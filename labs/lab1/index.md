# CS 142 Lab 1

## Part A: Leroy and the Cookies

<img src="leroy.jpg" width=300 align=right>
In Part A, you will play a game already written for you in Java.  Through 
playing the game and investigating the code, you will practice with Java 
variables, if statements, and loops.

### Getting started

1. Start IntelliJ.  From the screen that appears, choose "New Project."

2. On the "New Project" screen, pick a name for your project, for example "lab1."  
   It's easier if it doesn't have spaces in it.  

   Choose a location for your project.  I suggest making a folder dedicated just
   to CS142 projects, and then storing your project in this folder.

   If the "JDK" section of this screen says "No JDK", click the dropdown box and
   choose "Download JDK."  Pick version 18, and the Oracle vendor.  Click "Download."

   Unselect the checkbox for "Add sample code." 

   Once the JDK is downloaded, you can click "Create" to create your project.

3. Download the following three files to your computer (make sure you know where they're
   being downloaded to):
   
   (This may involve right-clicking and choosing "Save As" or "Save Link As") depending
   on your operating system and browser.

   - [LeroyAndTheCookies.java](LeroyAndTheCookies.java)
   - [LeroyAndTheCookies.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkirlin/cs142-f22/main/labs/lab1/LeroyAndTheCookies.md)
   - [OneIsZero.java](OneIsZero.java)

3. In the left-hand panel, find the `src` folder.  This is where your Java files 
   should reside.  Find the three files above on your computer and drag-and-drop them
   into the `src` folder in IntelliJ.

4. In the left-hand panel, double-click on `LeroyAndTheCookies.java`.  Click the "run"
   button (green triangle) in the upper-right area of IntelliJ to run the Java code.  If
   it doesn't run, ask for help.

   Now you're ready to start the lab!

5. In the left-hand panel, double-click on `LeroyAndTheCookies.md`.  Follow
    the instructions in this file.  This is where you will answer the questions
    for the lab.

## Part B: One Is Zero

After you finish Part A, try to write the second program from our previous
class, "One is Zero."  Directions are in the `OneIsZero.java` file (or see the
class webpage or your handout.)
