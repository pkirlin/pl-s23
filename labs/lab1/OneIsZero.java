/**
 * Write a program to simulate a single turn of the game "One is Zero." The game works
 * like this:
 * – During a turn, you roll a six-sided die.
 * – If you roll 2-6, you get that number of points and may roll again to get more
 * points, or you may choose to end your turn. Whenever you choose to end your
 * turn, you earn all the accumulated points from the previous die rolls.
 * – However, if you ever roll a 1, your turn ends, you lose any points you already
 * accumulated for that turn, and you earn zero total points for that turn.
 * – Print the total points you receive for that turn at the end.
 * – Bonus: If there is time, allow two players to alternate taking turns (points
 * accumulate for each turn), and after five turns each, the game ends. Print final
 * point totals and the winner.
