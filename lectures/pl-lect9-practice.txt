Write a function called scale that takes a list of numbers and a number, 
  and returns a new list with all the numbers scaled by the number supplied.
	Hint: use map and an anonymous function.
	
	Ex: (scale '(1 2 3) 2) ==> '(2 4 6)
	
Write a function called keep-odds that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list 
  with all only the numbers that are odd retained.
	
	Hint: There's a built-in function (odd? p) that returns #t if p is odd.  Use filter
	and odd?.
	
	Ex: (keep-odds '(1 2 3)) ==> '(1 3)
	
Write a function called keep-greater-than that takes a number x and an addition list of
        numbers.  This function returns a new list only the numbers that greater than x 
	retained.
	
	Ex: (keep-greater-than 3 '(3 5 2 7 4)) ==> '(5 7 4)
	
Write a higher-order function called find that takes a function and a list.
  The function argument must be a function of a single value and return #t or #f (aka
  a predicate).  Find should return the first element in the list that satisfies
  the predicate (makes the function return true).
  
  Do not use filter for this, even though it would be very simple.  (That algorithm 
  would be rather inefficient if the list were very long but the first item in the list 
  satisfied the predicate, because filter would still have to filter all the remaining 
  elements.)
  
  Ex: (find odd? '(2 4 3 5)) ==> 3
  Ex: (find (lambda (x) (< x 0)) '(3 2 1 0 -1 -2)) ==> -1
  Ex: (find (lambda (lst) (even? (car lst))) '((1 2 3) (4 5 6) (7 8 9))) ==> '(4 5 6)
  
Write a higher-order function called greatest that takes a predicate and a list.  The 
  predicate must be a comparison predicate of two arguments (e.g., < or >).  greatest 
  returns the element in the list that the comparison operator says is #t for all the 
  elements in the list when compared against each other.
  
  Ex: (greatest > '(1 3 2 4 6 5)) ==> 6
  Ex: (greatest < '(1 3 2 4 6 5)) ==> 1
  Ex: (greatest before? '((2012 4 2) (2012 1 3) (2012 10 10))) ==> '(2012 1 3)
  
Write a higher-order function called count that takes a predicate and a list, and returns
	the number of items in the list that satisfy the predicate.
	
	Write this in two ways: first using filter, then again not using filter.
	
Write two higher-order predicate functions called any and all.  Each takes a predicate 
  and a list as arguments.  Any returns #t if any of the items in the list satisfy the 
  predicate.  All returns #t if all the elements satisfy the predicate.

  Ex: (any odd? '(1 2 3 4)) ==> #t
  Ex: (any odd? '(2 4 6 8)) ==> #f
  Ex: (all even? '(2 4 6 8)) ==> #t
  Ex: (all even? '(1 2 3 4)) ==> #f
  
  Write these first from scratch without using filter.  Then write them by using filter.
  Then write them using count.  Which way(s) are more efficient (in terms of time) than others?

- Write a function make-gt which takes a number n and returns a function of a single
argument x that evalutes to #t if n > x.

  Ex: (define gt5 (make-gt 5))
      (filter gt5 '(2 4 6 8)) ==> '(6 8)
      
- Write a function called make-polynomial that takes a list of coefficients and returns
a function that represents the equivalent polynomial.
  Ex: (make-polynomial '(2 1)) returns the polynomial 2x + 1, or rather it
          returns the function (lambda (x) (+ (* 2 x) 1))
          
  Ex: (make-polynomial '(2 4 -8)) returns the polynomial 2x^2 + 4x - 8
    This should work for a list of any length.  A polynomial for a list of length
    zero is the zero polynomial f(x) = 0.
      
  You should be able to do something like
  (map (make-polynomial '(2 1)) '(1 2 3)) ==> '(3 5 7)
      
- Write filter and count (from the previous lecture) in terms of foldr.

- Write max in terms of foldr.  You may assume all the numbers you will be comparing
are positive.
