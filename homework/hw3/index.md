# CS142: Homework 3

Homework problems are intended to give you more practice with shorter programs than the larger "projects" do.
Typically these problems will also give you an idea of what you might see on tests.  You also get immediate
feedback.

This is another CodeCheck homework.  If you've forgotten how this works, look at homework 1.

<B>Important</b>: If CodeCheck has been not saving your work, try making sure to click the "CodeCheck" button towards
the button whenever you walk away for a bit, even if you're not ready to test your code.  If you're still having
problems, you can also paste in the code and/or screenshots of all the test cases passing when you submit to Canvas.

[Here's the link for the assignment.](https://codecheck.io/assignment/2111040348ehv4ll73f4cuycdqilsfije64)

When you're all done, paste your CodeCheck ID into the Canvas assignment and submit it.
